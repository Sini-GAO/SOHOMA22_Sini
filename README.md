# SOHOMA22_Sini

This is the document in Sini's manuscript submitted to SOHOMA22. There are four branches in this project: main, Programming-for-numerical-example-1, Programming-for-numerical-example-2 and Programming-for-numerical-example-3.

In each branch, it has: 
      (1) Exhaustive search code for the corresponding numerical example; 
      (2) The exact Pareto-optimal solutions for the corresponding numerical example;
      (3) The Q-learning solution approach code for the corresponding numerical example;
      (4) The approximate Pareto-optimal solutions for the corresponding numerical example.

All (1) and (3) will be shared after the manuscript is accepted.
